# Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Tracker
Just tried to create a simple web app tracker to track tracks (duh) to know which tracks were already picked in a competitive format, maybe this can be updated to Mario Kart World at some point


# Goal
As stated above, this is just to track tracks (duh) played in a competitive Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (MK8D) to just not pick an already picked track. Of course this has limitations with certain rulesets, but since I barely play them, that's a problem for a future me if I wanted to update the code, or someone else if they wanted to modify or update this spaghetti code, be my guest hahaha

# Usage
1) Search a Track, either manually scrolling, or using the search bar. I've added the full tracklist with the codes they have on several MK8D Discord Communities and how they are also found in [shortcat.pro](https://shortcat.pro/) so you can check after picking it, the best strats for the track.
If using the search bar, you can click on "Clear" to remove whatever is typed
2) Tracks will show in another column with the order they are picked.
3) After finishing, you can click on "Clear All" to remove them.

# App
It might have unintentional bugs (I hope mostly spelling mistakes), either they don't bother me, or I might have failed ChatGPT's promtp. YES, I shamefully used ChatGPT for this, I have basic programming knowledge, so I technically can read code and understand, but not build it in a timely manner.
I'm not a dev/programmer, and I wasn't looking for something pretty, just something that is usable. I experimented first with Google Web Apps, but it kinda got buggy and couldn't fix without breaking other stuff, so this will do as an evolution.

I'm sorry if this offends you, for me it was a proyect to know if I could not be the worst client ever, making as clear as a proposal to ChatGPT to have as few mistakes as possible, if I had money I probably would've bugged a friend or something.

# Bugs
If any and really bother you, try to reach me on [Twitter](https://x.com/kalarse_) or [Bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/kalarse.bsky.social), but considering this is just a fun trying to make a WebApp and considering Mario Kart World is about to be released, I'm not gonna spend much time on it, unless something really is broken lol
